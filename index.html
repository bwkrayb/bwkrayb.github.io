      <p>This is where I will store various project write ups because everyone wants them. I mean, I want them too. Deleting reddit made me realize I don't actually have a place to share this stuff anymore. So enjoy enjoy my write ups in all their simple html/css glory.</p>
      <p>All of these projects are super inconvenient. I love inconvience so much that I'm literally writing this on a Clockworkpi DevTerm (a lovely litte Tandy-esc looking Linux handhled. I actually have the matching Tandy from the early 80s, and will probably write up something for that project soon) I'm not here to make a perfect project or toy. In fact, the more I watch people get a lot of attention for their own projects, the less I want to be like them. I strive for sitting around and staring at my projects collecting dust on a shelf, just waiting for me to find some random motivation to continue them.</p>
